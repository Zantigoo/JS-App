## A Pokedex project

This slick little app here is a basic build of the classic pokedex pulling info right off the PokeApi. 

Holds the original 151, a slick theme, and some basic info on it's entries.

The type icons are [duiker101's slick SVGs](https://github.com/duiker101/pokemon-type-svg-icons)
